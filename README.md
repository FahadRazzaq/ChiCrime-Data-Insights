## Chicago Crimes Data Analysis (2010-2017)

This repository contains a data analysis and predictive modeling project on the Chicago Crimes dataset for the years 2010 to 2017, completed as part of an Advanced Data Mining course. The project involves analyzing the data, preprocessing, and building a predictive model using Random Forest.

### Project Components:

#### Data Import and Preprocessing
The project begins with importing the necessary libraries and the dataset. The data is then cleaned by removing irrelevant attributes and handling NaN values. The date is split into Day, Month, Year, Hour, Minute, and Second for further analysis.

#### Data Analysis
The cleaned data is then analyzed through various visualizations. The correlation between different features is studied and relevant features are selected for the predictive model.

#### Predictive Modeling
A Random Forest model is used for prediction. The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training data and predictions are made on the test data. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.

This project is for educational purposes only. 

**NOTE:** Please ensure to install necessary libraries mentioned in the code to run the project.

### Libraries Used: 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Yellowbrick
